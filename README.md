## Goals of Stygofauna Mundi {-}

There are many databases out there, but Stygofauna Mundi is build in a way that you can freely access and comment on all the information. In this spirit, we have initially define the following goals:

1. Make distribution and evolutionary data on subterranean aquatic animal diversity accessible to everyone

2. Provide a common framework to work on subterranean and microscopic animals, fully interoperable with other existing databases.

3. Encourage collaboration and exchange of data amongst researche

4. Facilitate testing eco-evolutionary hypothesis

5. Share all the scripts, information, and sources in a fully open code framework.


## Acknoledgements {-}

This project is hosted by the [Molecular Ecology Group](http://www.meg.irsa.cnr.it/) at the [Water Research Institute in Verbania](http://www.irsa.cnr.it/index.php/ita/) (National Research Council of Italy).

This project started in the frame of the 2017-2019 Marie Curie project ["ANCAVE - Anchialine caves as model of Evolution (745530)"](https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/415761-new-database-increases-knowledge-of-subterranean-evolution) to Alejandro Mart√≠nez, hosted by Diego Fontaneto.

The project was subsequently expanded in close collaboration with Stefano Mammola and Tommaso Cancellario. Further collaborators and authors of the different parts of the database are summarized in the section XX
